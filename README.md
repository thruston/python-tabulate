Tabulate
--------

Line up tabular material neatly.

An exportable module that will line up tabular material automatically 
saving you hours of time faffing about with format and alignment. 
As a script it provide a filter with a simple DSL that can be used to 
make and manipulate tables in editors like Vim.
